# oro restore

Resolves and extracts a `node_modules/` tree

### Usage:

```
oro restore [OPTIONS]
```

[aliases: r, res]

### Options

#### `--prefer-copy`

When extracting packages, prefer to copy files files instead of linking them.

This option has no effect if hard linking fails (for example, if the cache is on a different drive), or if the project is on a filesystem that supports Copy-on-Write (zfs, btrfs, APFS (macOS), etc).

#### `-v, --validate`

Validate the integrity of installed files.

When this is true, orogene will verify all files extracted from the cache, as well as verify that any files in the existing `node_modules` are unmodified. If verification fails, the packages will be reinstalled.

#### `--lockfile-only`

Whether to skip restoring packages into `node_modules` and just resolve the tree and write the lockfile

#### `--ignore-scripts`

Skip running install scripts

#### `--default-tag <DEFAULT_TAG>`

Default dist-tag to use when resolving package versions

\[default: latest]

#### `--concurrency <CONCURRENCY>`

Controls number of concurrent operations during various restore steps (resolution fetches, extractions, etc).

Tuning this might help reduce memory usage (if lowered), or improve performance (if increased).

\[default: 50]

#### `--script-concurrency <SCRIPT_CONCURRENCY>`

Controls number of concurrent script executions while running `run_script`.

This option is separate from `concurrency` because executing concurrent scripts is a much heavier operation.

\[default: 6]

#### `--no-lockfile`

Skip writing the lockfile

#### `-h, --help`

Print help (see a summary with '-h')

#### `-V, --version`

Print version

### Global Options

#### `--root <ROOT>`

Path to the project to operate on.

By default, Orogene will look up from the current working directory until it finds a directory with a `package.json` file or a `node_modules/` directory.

\[default: .]

#### `--registry <REGISTRY>`

Registry used for unscoped packages

\[default: https://registry.npmjs.org]

#### `--scoped-registry <SCOPED_REGISTRIES>`

Registry to use for a specific `@scope`, using `--scoped-registry @scope=https://foo.com` format.

Can be provided multiple times to specify multiple scoped registries.

#### `--cache <CACHE>`

Location of disk cache.

Default location varies by platform.

#### `--config <CONFIG>`

File to read configuration values from.

When specified, global configuration loading is disabled and configuration values will only be read from this location.

#### `--loglevel <LOGLEVEL>`

Log output level/directive.

Supports plain loglevels (off, error, warn, info, debug, trace) as well as more advanced directives in the format `target[span{field=value}]=level`.

\[default: info]

#### `-q, --quiet`

Disable all output

#### `--json`

Format output as JSON

#### `--progress`

Whether to display a progress bar for long operations. Use `--no-progress` to disable

#### `--emoji`

Whether to display emoji. Use `--no-emoji` to disable.

By default, this will show emoji when outputting to a TTY that supports unicode.
