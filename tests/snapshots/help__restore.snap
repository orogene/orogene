# oro restore

Resolves and extracts a node_modules/ tree

### Usage:

```
oro restore [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

#### `-p, --prefer-copy`

Prefer copying files over hard linking them.

On filesystems that don't support copy-on-write/reflinks (usually NTFS or ext4), orogene defaults to hard linking package files from a centralized cache. As such, this can cause global effects if a file inside a node_modules is modified, where other projects that have installed that same file will see those modifications.

In order to prevent this, you can use this flag to force orogene to always copy files, at a performance cost.

#### `-v, --validate`

Validate the integrity of installed files.

When this is true, orogene will verify all files extracted from the cache, as well as verify that any files in the existing `node_modules` are unmodified. If verification fails, the packages will be reinstalled.

#### `--lockfile-only`

Whether to skip restoring packages into `node_modules` and just resolve the tree and write the lockfile

#### `--ignore-scripts`

Skip running install scripts

#### `-h, --help`

Print help (see a summary with '-h')

#### `-V, --version`

Print version

### Global Options

#### `--root <ROOT>`

Package path to operate on

#### `--registry <REGISTRY>`

Registry used for unscoped packages.

Defaults to https://registry.npmjs.org.

#### `--cache <CACHE>`

Location of disk cache.

Default location varies by platform.

#### `--config <CONFIG>`

File to read configuration values from.

When specified, global configuration loading is disabled and configuration values will only be read from this location.

#### `--loglevel <LOGLEVEL>`

Log output level/directive.

Supports plain loglevels (off, error, warn, info, debug, trace) as well as more advanced directives in the format `target[span{field=value}]=level`.

#### `-q, --quiet`

Disable all output

#### `--json`

Format output as JSON

Disable progress bar display
