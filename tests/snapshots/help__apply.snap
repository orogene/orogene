# oro apply

Applies the current project's requested dependencies to `node_modules/`, adding, removing, and updating dependencies as needed. This command is intended to be an idempotent way to make sure your `node_modules` is in the right state to execute, based on your declared dependencies

### Usage:

```
oro apply [OPTIONS]
```

[aliases: a, ap, app]

### Options

#### `--prefer-copy`

When extracting packages, prefer to copy files files instead of linking them.

This option has no effect if hard linking fails (for example, if the cache is on a different drive), or if the project is on a filesystem that supports Copy-on-Write (zfs, btrfs, APFS (macOS), etc).

#### `-v, --validate`

Validate the integrity of installed files.

When this is true, orogene will verify all files extracted from the cache, as well as verify that any files in the existing `node_modules` are unmodified. If verification fails, the packages will be reinstalled.

#### `--lockfile-only`

Whether to skip restoring packages into `node_modules` and just resolve the tree and write the lockfile

#### `--ignore-scripts`

Skip running install scripts

#### `--default-tag <DEFAULT_TAG>`

Default dist-tag to use when resolving package versions

\[default: latest]

#### `--concurrency <CONCURRENCY>`

Controls number of concurrent operations during various apply steps (resolution fetches, extractions, etc).

Tuning this might help reduce memory usage (if lowered), or improve performance (if increased).

\[default: 50]

#### `--script-concurrency <SCRIPT_CONCURRENCY>`

Controls number of concurrent script executions while running `run_script`.

This option is separate from `concurrency` because executing concurrent scripts is a much heavier operation.

\[default: 6]

#### `--lockfile`

Whether to write the lockfile after operations complete. Disable by using `--no-lockfile`.

Note that lockfiles are only written after all operations complete successfully.

#### `--hoisted`

Use the hoisted installation mode, where all dependencies and their transitive dependencies are installed as high up in the `node_modules` tree as possible.

This can potentially mean that packages have access to dependencies they did not specify in their package.json, but it might be useful for compatibility.

By default, dependencies are installed in "isolated" mode, using a symlink/junction structure to simulate a dependency tree.

#### `-h, --help`

Print help (see a summary with '-h')

#### `-V, --version`

Print version

### Global Options

#### `--root <ROOT>`

Path to the project to operate on.

By default, Orogene will look up from the current working directory until it finds a directory with a `package.json` file or a `node_modules/` directory.

\[default: .]

#### `--registry <REGISTRY>`

Registry used for unscoped packages

\[default: https://registry.npmjs.org]

#### `--scoped-registry <SCOPED_REGISTRIES>`

Registry to use for a specific `@scope`, using `--scoped-registry @scope=https://foo.com` format.

Can be provided multiple times to specify multiple scoped registries.

#### `--cache <CACHE>`

Location of disk cache.

Default location varies by platform.

#### `--config <CONFIG>`

File to read configuration values from.

When specified, global configuration loading is disabled and configuration values will only be read from this location.

#### `--loglevel <LOGLEVEL>`

Log output level/directive.

Supports plain loglevels (off, error, warn, info, debug, trace) as well as more advanced directives in the format `target[span{field=value}]=level`.

\[default: info]

#### `-q, --quiet`

Disable all output

#### `--json`

Format output as JSON

#### `--progress`

Whether to display a progress bar for long operations. Use `--no-progress` to disable

#### `--emoji`

Whether to display emoji. Use `--no-emoji` to disable.

By default, this will show emoji when outputting to a TTY that supports unicode.
