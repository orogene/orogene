Orogene is a next-generation package manager for tools that use
`node_modules/`, such as bundlers, CLI tools, and Node.js-based
applications. It's fast, robust, and meant to be easily integrated into
your workflows such that you never have to worry about whether your
`node_modules/` is up to date.

> *Note*: Orogene is still under heavy development and may not yet be
> suitable for production use. It is missing some features that you might
> expect. Check [the roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/orogene/projects/2)
> to see where we're headed and [talk to
> us](https://github.com/orogene/orogene/discussions/categories/pain-points)
> about what you want/need!.

### Getting Started

You can install Orogene in various ways:

npx:
```sh
$ npx oro ping
```

NPM:
```sh
$ npm install -g oro
```

Cargo:
```sh
$ cargo install orogene
```

You can also find install scripts and archive downloads in [the latest
release](https://github.com/orogene/orogene/releases/latest).

### Usage

For usage documentation, see [the Orogene
docs](https://orogene.dev/book/), or run `$ oro help`.

If you just want to do something similar to `$ npm install`, you can run
`$ oro apply` in your project and go from there.

### Compiling with Docker

```sh
$ docker build -t orogene .
```
Test it with

```sh
docker run -it --rm --name oro orogene /usr/src/orogene/target/release/oro --version
```

### Performance

Orogene is very fast and uses significantly fewer resources than other
package managers, in both memory and disk space. It's able to install some
non-trivial projects in sub-second time:
