Orogene is a next-generation package manager for tools that use
`node_modules/`, such as bundlers, CLI tools, and Node.js-based
applications. It's fast, robust, and meant to be easily integrated into
your workflows such that you never have to worry about whether your
`node_modules/` is up to date.

> *Note*: Orogene is still under heavy development and shouldn't be
> considered much more than a tech demo or proof of concept. Do not use in
> production yet.

#### Performance

Orogene is pretty fast and uses fewer resources than other package
managers! For details and benchmarks, see [the benchmarks]
